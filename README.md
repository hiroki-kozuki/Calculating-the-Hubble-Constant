# Measuring-the-Hubble-Constant
A 1st year computing project for the undergraduate physics course at Imperial College London.
Two real data sets (distances of planets from Earth and their Hydrogen spectral intensities) were given.
Mean observed frequency for each planet (50 planets in total) was determined by plotting the spectral intensity (arbitrary units) against the observed frequency range (Hz), generating a linear gaussian fit, and finding the mean frequency of the Gaussian.
The mean red shift velocity of each planet was calculated from its mean frequency value. 
The Hubble constant was determined by interpolating the graph of red shift velocity vs. distance from Earth. 
Experimental Hubble constant = 77 +/- 5 km/sMpc.
